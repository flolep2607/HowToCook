I've been quarantined at home recently and can't go out. Just stay home and cook. As a programmer, I occasionally look for recipes and how-tos online. However, these recipes are often written in a variety of strange ways, and some materials are often inexplicable in the middle. Extremely unfriendly to programmers accustomed to formal languages.

Therefore, I plan to search for recipes by myself and combine the actual cooking experience to prepare the practice of common dishes with clearer and more accurate descriptions, so as to facilitate programmers to cook at home.

Again, I want it to be an open source project driven and maintained by the community, enabling more people to make a fun repository together. So everyone is very welcome to contribute it~
